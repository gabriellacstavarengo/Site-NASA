                    Food scarcity is a major social issue that harms human health and destabilizes communities. It occurs
                    when regions cannot produce, import, or afford enough nutritious food, leading to hunger, reduced
                    productivity, and social and economic instability. Recent United Nations data shows that over 735 million
                    people experienced chronic hunger in 2023, and about 2.4 billion faced moderate or severe food insecurity,
                    with Sub-Saharan Africa being the most affected region, where more than 20% of the population is
                    undernourished. The causes are complex and include climate-related droughts and floods that reduce crop
                    yields, conflicts that disrupt distribution, economic crises and inflation that raise food prices, and
                    agricultural systems that struggle to meet global demand.

                    The FAO Hunger Map shows that global hunger is unevenly distributed, with Sub-Saharan Africa facing the
                    highest levels — over 20% of its population is undernourished, compared to a global average of about 8%.
                    While some regions have seen slight improvements, many areas with chronic hunger show limited progress due
                    to conflict, climate impacts, weak infrastructure, and economic instability. The map highlights the need
                    for targeted action and investment in resilient food systems to reduce hunger where it is most severe.
